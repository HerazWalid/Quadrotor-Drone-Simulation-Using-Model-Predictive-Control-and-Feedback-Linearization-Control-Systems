# Quadrotor-Drone-Simulation-Using-Model-Predictive-Control-and-Feedback-Linearization-Control-Systems
Quadrotor drones, known for their compact size and agility, are a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used in various applications. This project addresses the challenge of controlling their complex 3D movement by developing a mathematical model to analyze their dynamics. The proposed control system integrates Model Predictive Control (MPC) for precise orientation along desired flight paths, by anticipating future states and optimizing control inputs, with Feedback Linearization Control for real-time position stabilization through continuous motor output adjustments based on reference coordinates. The effectiveness of this combined approach was validated through MATLAB® simulations, demonstrating the UAV’s ability to follow various paths while maintaining desired positions, velocities, and angles. This approach significantly improves flight precision and stability, paving the way for broader applications in autonomous tasks such as delivery and search and rescue.
